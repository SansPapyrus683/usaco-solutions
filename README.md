# usaco solutions

so this is my USACO repo with all the solutions that i've either finished or just given up on
and copied the solution lol  

~~don't ask where the other problems in section one went~~  

update (12/10/2020):  
boom i did all the problems in part 1, with good variable names too!

ok now all the official problems will be just using stdin and stdout, so yeah conventions are camelCase for java,
and snake_case for python and c++ (though there's like basically no c++ solutions lol)


## some small nitpicks

* there might be some debug prints left in the files, but that shouldn't affect anything
* the package names are there so vs code doesn't have a meltdown with the files lol (the thing is intellij handles them just fine)
* i have some weak input validation, but that's just for my debugging, you don't have to worry about it
* i also learned that java package names can't have capital letters, but it's not like anyone's using this lol
* another thing i realized after coding a ton of dijkstra's sols is that my priority queues are coded wrong, but they still get ac'd
